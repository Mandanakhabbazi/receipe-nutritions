# The healthiest diet: a comparison of recipes of various diets to what is universal perceived as healthy in terms of macronutrients #

## 1. Motivation ##
### 1.1 For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description. ### 


### 1.2 Who created this dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? ###

### 1.3 Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number. ###

## 2. Composition ##
### 2.1 What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description. ###
Each instance in the dataset is a dinner recipe. These recipes will be categorized into the five most popular diets for the users from Edamam. The users who use Edamam the most are from Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and India. Therefore the following five recipes will make the categorization; Keto diet, Mediterranean diet, Paleo diet, DASH diet and Vegan diet. These diets are the overall most popular in the countries stated above. The diets have multiple types of instances, namely the macronutrients. Those are categorized as fat, protein and carbs. For each recipe, the macronutrients are listed in the database. 

### 2.2 How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)? ###
For all 5 recipes, there is a different number of recipes available. Table 1 below shows a calculation of the total number of recipes from which data is collected. The total number of instances in the dataframe are 34,898 in the latest API from Edamam. However, if the API changes, the number of instances can be altered. The API from Edamam has a limitation of maximum 10,000 calls a month and 10 calls per minute. One call from the Edamam API retrieves 20 recipes. Therefore, you will need 34,898/20 = 1744.9 requests to get data of all 5 recipes. Due to the limitation of the API, you need 1744.9/10/60 = 2.9 hours to gather all data. Since the number of requests required does not exceed the limit of 10,000 calls per month, the data can be easily collected with a single API key.

```{r}
install.packages('Matrix')
library(Matrix)
tab <- matrix(c(2323, 10000, 10000, 4635, 7940), ncol=1, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(tab) <- c('Numer of recipes available')
rownames(tab) <- c('Keto', 'Vegan', 'Dash', 'Mediterranean', 'Paleo')
tab <- as.table(tab)
tab
```

### 2.3 Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable). ###

This dataset is a sample of the entire Edamam recipe API. The Recipe Search API (the endpoint this project uses) contains over 2.3 million recipes.As mentioned, the dataset contains a selection of recipes based on the diets we are interested in. All the recipes of all five diets are collected, which means the sample is representable looking at the diets independently. However, the total of 34,898 instances is not representative of the larger set, but this was not the goal of this data collection. The goal is to obtain data from each recipe of each diet independently.

### 2.5 Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description. ###

### 2.6 Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text. ###

### 2.7 Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit. ###

### 2.8 Are there any recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them. ###

### 2.9 Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate. ###

### 2.10 Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description. ###

### 2.11 Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why. ###

### 2.12	Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. ###

## 3. Collection Process ##
### 3.1 How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how. ###

### 3.2	What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated? ###

### 3.3 If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)? ###

### 3.4	Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)? ###

### 3.5	Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created. ###

### 3.6 Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation. ###

### 3.7 Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. ###

## 4. Preprocessing, cleaning, labeling ##
### 4.1 Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section. ###

### 4.2	Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point to the “raw” data. ###

### 4.3	Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available? If so, please provide a link or other access point. ###

## 5. Uses ##
### 5.1	Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please provide a description. ###

### 5.2	Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or other access point. ###

### 5.3	What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? ###

### 5.4	Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable harms? ###

### 5.5	Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description. ###
