Consuming a healthy diet helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases and conditions. Lately, there are many diets, all promising to be te best and healthiest wat to nourish your body. Some examples are Paleo, Keto, Intermittent fasting, Mediterranean and Vegetarian. Each diet comes with certain recipes, that should inspire you to eat a certain way. But how do you know whether the diet you are following is actually healthy? 

The World's Health Organization generated basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet. These principles look into the average nutritional requirements for humans. According to these principles, we can determine whether recipes from a particular diet are healthy or not.




The purpose of this project is to create a dataset in which various diet recipes are evaluated in terms of nutrients.
