# Which diet to choose!?

Consuming a healthy diet helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases and conditions. Lately, there are many diets, all promising to be te best and healthiest wat to nourish your body. Some examples are Paleo, Keto, Intermittent fasting, Mediterranean and Vegetarian. Each diet comes with certain recipes, that should inspire you to eat a certain way. But how do you know whether the diet you are following is actually perceived as "healthy"?

Using the Edamame API, we created a code to generate a dataset with recipes from different diets. Using this, you can document the macronutrients of each recipe that belongs to a specific diet. From now on, you no longer have to overthink which diet to follow or which recipe to choose! 

We wish you lots of joy using our Edamame API scraper :)
